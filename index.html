      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Hi, my name is Donchelle Santiaguin, and today I’m presenting my capstone project, <strong>LIFE.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is deeply personal to me—rooted in my desire to give back to the community. 
        There was once a little girl who was taken from her mother and placed into the foster care system.
        Her father fought for her, and she grew up being moved back and forth, just wanting peace.
        No child should have to carry that kind of emotional weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        She remembers sitting in quiet rooms with strangers, being asked to talk about her feelings—
        a huge task for someone so young. The sandbox, the blank papers… those tools became ways to express
        what she couldn’t yet verbalize.
        <strong>That little girl was me.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        At four years old, I was already in therapy, trying to make sense of things I couldn’t understand.
        As I got older, I wondered how many other children felt the same—unsupported, unheard, or unsure where to turn.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        That’s where <strong>LIFE.</strong> was born: from a simple desire to build a safe, human-like space where young people 
        can feel seen, understood, and supported.

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
  Communicating with a therapist is rarely simple and often comes with both challenges and benefits. Barriers such as cost, insurance, cultural sensitivity, lack of personalization, privacy, and language differences can make access difficult. At the same time, therapy can create space for feeling heard, gaining comfort, encouraging personal reflection, and
fostering new perspectives that support healing across
generations.

      <p>
        Data collected from 2019-2023 shows significant increases in reported emotional struggles among both middle and high school students.
        Middle schoolers reported rising levels of stress, sadness, and difficulty focusing—jumping from <strong>23%</strong> in 2019 to over
        <strong>70%</strong> by 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        High schoolers followed a similar trend, with emotional fatigue rising from <strong>28%</strong> to <strong>70%</strong>. 
        These patterns reflect the urgent need for early, accessible support systems that feel safe and familiar. <br><br> https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-youth/mental-health/index.html

    <h2>Process & Design Evolution</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      LIFE. evolved through experimentation, feedback, and a desire to create a supportive digital space that feels warm,
      clear, and emotionally intuitive. Below is a look at the visual journey—from early concepts to the final creative
      direction.
    </p>

    <div class="process-text">
      <h3>Establishing the Visual Foundation</h3>
      <p>
        The early stages of LIFE. began by exploring color palettes, typography, illustration styles, and brand assets.
        I experimented with soft tones, friendly shapes, and organic line work to build an identity that feels calming
        and empathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        These foundational elements helped define LIFE.'s recognizable personality—warm, inviting, and emotionally
        reassuring.

  <!-- 2. EARLY DESIGN CHALLENGES — IMAGE RIGHT -->
  <div class="process-row reverse reveal">
    <div class="process-text">
      <h3>Refining the Early Direction</h3>
      <p>
        Early prototypes revealed several challenges. Some visuals were <strong>too dainty and soft</strong>,
        making hierarchy and readability difficult. Muted tones blended into backgrounds, and contrast needed
        improvement for accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through refinement, I introduced stronger color balance, improved spacing, clearer typography, and a more
        grounded tone—while keeping the emotional softness that defines the brand.
